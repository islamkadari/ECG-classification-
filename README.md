# ECG-classification-
In this project, we propose a system for the automatic classication of ECG
arrhythmias using different Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
To classify the ECG signals we will go to the multi-class classication, we use
a database which contains 5 classes that correspond to types of heart disease.
The multi-class classication will allow us to find the type of the disease
